sniffer.py [-i interface] [-r tracefile] expression

-i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0) indefinitely. If not
    specified, the program should pick a default interface to listen on.
-r  Read packets from <tracefile> (tcpdump format). Useful for analyzing
    network traces that have been captured previously.
The optional <expression> argument is a BPF filter that specifies a subset of
the traffic to be monitored (similar to tcpdump).

Your tool should perform the following operations
1) HTTP traffic, GET and POST requests are parsed and printed along with the host name and the request URI
2) TLS traffic, the Client Hello message is parsed and printed along with the version number, destination host name

-i --> seems to only work with the following interfaces [eth0, lo]
-r <tracefile.pcap> <expression> --> When filtering a trace file some of the expressions that work: [HTTP, TLS]
sniffer.py <expression> --> When filtering with no trace file some of the expressions that work: ['port 80', 'port 443', ...]
sniffer.py [-I interface] <expression> --> has the same available expressions as above
